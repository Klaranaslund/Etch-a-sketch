/** Add a button to the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. 
 * Once entered, the existing grid should be removed and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) 
 * so that youâ€™ve got a new sketch pad. 
 * 
 * Tip: Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100.
 * A larger number of squares results in more computer resources being used, potentially causing delays, freezing, or crashing that we want to prevent.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Research button tags in HTML and how you can make a JavaScript function run when one is clicked. Also check out prompts.
 * You should be able to enter 64 and have a brand new 64x64 grid pop up without changing the total amount of pixels used
